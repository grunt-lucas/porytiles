# Porytiles

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/workflows/Build%20Porytiles/badge.svg)](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/actions)

Overworld tileset compiler for use with the [`pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald),
[`pokefirered`](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered), and [`pokeruby`](https://github.com/pret/pokeruby) PokÃ©mon
Generation 3 decompilation projects from [`pret`](https://github.com/pret). Builds
[Porymap](https://github.com/huderlem/porymap)-ready tilesets from RGBA (or indexed) tile assets.

Please see the [Releases](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/releases) for the latest stable version, or check out
the [`trunk`](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/tree/trunk) branch to get the upcoming changes listed in the
[changelog](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/blob/trunk/CHANGELOG.md).

## Why Should I Use This Tool?

Porytiles makes importing from-scratch tilesets (or editing existing tilesets) easier than ever. Think of it this way:
just like [Poryscript](https://github.com/huderlem/poryscript) takes a `.script` file and generates a corresponding `.inc`
file as part of your build, Porytiles takes an source folder containing RGBA (or indexed) tile assets and generates a
corresponding `metatiles.bin`, `metatile_attributes.bin`, indexed `tiles.png`, indexed `anim` folder, and a populated
`palettes` folder -- all as part of your build!

For more info, please see
[this wiki page which explains what Porytiles can do in more detail.](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/wiki/Why-Should-I-Use-This-Tool%3F)

## Compiler Information

Clang+LLVM 16 is the "official" Porytiles build toolchain -- the Porytiles formatting/coverage/tidy scripts rely on LLVM
tools to function. However, most reasonable C++ compilers should be able to build the executable, assuming they have
support for the C++20 standard. In addition to Clang+LLVM, the Porytiles CI pipeline runs a build job with GCC 13. I
try to maintain compatibility with that compiler, should you prefer it over Clang+LLVM.

## Getting Started

First, clone and build Porytiles. (Alternatively, you can skip the build step by downloading a release binary from the
[Releases](https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles/releases) tab.)

```
git clone https://github.com/grunt-lucas/porytiles.git
cd porytiles
CXX=clang++ make check
./release/bin/porytiles --help
```

Once you've cloned and built Porytiles, try the following little demo.

1. Open a `pokeemerald` project (`pokefirered` and `pokeruby` are also supported via command line options) in Porymap. Porytiles supports both dual and triple layer tile project configurations.

2. In Porymap, select `Tools -> New Tileset`. Create a primary set called `PorytilesPrimaryTest`.

3. In Porymap, right click one of the map groups and create a new map called `PorytilesTestMap`. For this map's primary tileset, select `gTileset_PorytilesPrimaryTest`. Then save the map.

4. Run one of the following commands, depending on the layer type of your project. Replace `<path/to/project>` with the path to your project.

Dual layer:
```
./release/bin/porytiles compile-primary -Wall -dual-layer -o <path/to/project>/data/tilesets/primary/porytiles_primary_test res/examples/simple_primary_1 res/examples/metatile_behaviors.h
```

Triple layer:
```
./release/bin/porytiles compile-primary -Wall -o <path/to/project>/data/tilesets/primary/porytiles_primary_test res/examples/simple_primary_1 res/examples/metatile_behaviors.h
```

5. In Porymap, select `File -> Reload Project`.

6. The metatile picker on the right should now show a basic tileset! Start mapping on your new map, and then save.

7. Open one of the layer PNGs in `res/examples/simple_primary_1` and edit it. Re-run the command from Step 4, and then reload Porymap again like in Step 5. You should see your changes reflected in both the map and the metatile picker.

8. You can stop here and enjoy! Or, if you want to bring in a secondary set as well, please read on.

9. In Porymap, select `Tools -> New Tileset`. Create a secondary set called `PorytilesSecondaryTest`.

10. In Porymap, make sure `PorytilesTestMap` is open. Use the tileset selector to change `PorytilesTestMap`'s secondary tileset to `gTileset_PorytilesSecondaryTest`. Then save the map.

11. Again, run the command that corresponds to your project's layer type. Replace `<path/to/project>` with the path to your project.

Triple layer:
```
./release/bin/porytiles compile-secondary -Wall -o <path/to/project>/data/tilesets/secondary/porytiles_secondary_test res/examples/simple_secondary_1 res/examples/simple_primary_1 res/examples/metatile_behaviors.h
```
Dual layer:
```
./release/bin/porytiles compile-secondary -Wall -dual-layer -o <path/to/project>/data/tilesets/secondary/porytiles_secondary_test res/examples/simple_secondary_1 res/examples/simple_primary_1 res/examples/metatile_behaviors.h
```

12. In Porymap, select `File -> Reload Project`.

13. Your map now has a custom primary and secondary tileset! Feel free to keep editing these sets to see what Porytiles can do!
