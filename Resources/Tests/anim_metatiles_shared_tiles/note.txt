Right now, compiling this tileset yields:

    detected duplicate key frame tile, not allowed

The reason for this is if two different animations in the same tileset share any key tiles, then we
have to fail because the compiler won't know what to do when it encounters a key tile in the regular
tileset.

The way to solve this: make sure all your animation key frame files are unique. For example, in this tileset, we have
two different animated flowers that happen to share a bottom-right tile. So we can just add a couple pixels to the
key frame tile on one of them so it is unique. However, for the actual anim frames, we can have whatever we want, since
it will be copied into VRAM by the game-engine at a later time. So the actual anim frames can share an identical tile,
but Porytiles can use the unique key frames to figure out which animation it needs to link.

The vanilla games actually do this already. If you look at the water animations, the tiles on the tilesheet that
display in Porymap don't actually correspond to any animation frame, and are never actually visible in-game.
